# User Stories Documentation

## Location
All user stories live in the `user-stories/` folder at the project root.

## Rules
- Every distinct feature must have its own markdown file in `user-stories/` (e.g. `01-bottom-navigation.md`).
- When implementing a new feature or receiving new requirements from the user, create or update the corresponding user story file **before** writing code.
- Files are numbered and named with a short kebab-case slug: `NN-feature-name.md`.
- Keep each story **short and descriptive**: summary, key details, and behaviour notes. Avoid verbose prose.
- When modifying an existing feature, update its user story to reflect the changes.
- User stories serve as the single source of truth for feature intent; always reference them during implementation.
