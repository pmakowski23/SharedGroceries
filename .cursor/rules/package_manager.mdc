# Package Manager

- Always use `pnpm` for dependency management and scripts.
- Use `pnpm add` / `pnpm add -D` instead of `npm install`.
- Use `pnpm run <script>` (or `pnpm <script>` when appropriate) instead of `npm run`.
- Do not use `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` commands unless explicitly requested by the user.
