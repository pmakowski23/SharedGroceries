# Shared Page Header and Groceries Settings Row

## Summary

Use one reusable page header on all app pages with the page title on the left and the Nourishly logo on the right.

## Header Behaviour

- The same header component is used across Groceries, Recipes, Meal Planner, Meal Goal Settings, and Recipe Detail.
- Left side shows the current page name.
- Right side shows the app logo.

## Groceries Layout

- On the Groceries page, `Active list` is displayed in a row directly below the header.
- The `Settings` action is on that same row, aligned to the right of `Active list`.
