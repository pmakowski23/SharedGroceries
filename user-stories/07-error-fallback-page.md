# Global Error Fallback Page

- If a route throws during render or load, the app shows a dedicated fallback page instead of a blank or broken screen.
- The fallback page uses the same card/button visual style as the rest of the app.
- The screen offers two actions: retry rendering the failed route and navigate back to Groceries.
